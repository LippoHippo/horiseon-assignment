# Code Refactor Starter Code
# horiseon-assignment

This Project involved taking pre written code and fixing any
  bugs, typos, and overall leaving the code better than when 
  it started.

In the code I have left notes of any changes I made as well
  as cleaning up repetative lines creating single class 
  elements that worked for sections in the html that used
  many of different class names.
